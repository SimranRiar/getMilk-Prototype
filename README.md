# getMilk-Prototype

A working prototype of a game I'm working on. In this prototype, I'll be importing Unity assets to get a feel for what I want in terms of mechanics, look, and feel.

Game Narrative: Objective is to get milk. Run to the nearby Shoprite, pick up some milk, and return alive. Enemies will be lactose-intolerant zombies.

Implementation:
    - Imported assets for character, NPCs, and environment.
    - Use ProBuilder to build custom Shoprite.

Extra Features, if I have time:
    - Multiple Levels
    - Clock to record how long milk runs take
    - High score recording based on best times
    - Want to add real time map, with arrows pointing to destination
    - Multiple choice character selection (aka not just default character)
    - Combat with NPCs
    - High score recording based on enemies killed
